## Abstract

AI agents consume and produce structured data under fixed token budgets. The dominant encoding is JSON, which wastes 75%+ of tokens on structural overhead: field names, delimiters, and repeated identifiers. We present GCF (Graph Compact Format), a bidirectional text-based wire format for LLM interactions. GCF supports two encoding profiles: a **graph profile** exploiting referential identity (local IDs), topological encoding (edge arrows), and hierarchical grouping (section headers); and a **tabular profile** encoding arbitrary structured data with positional rows, pipe separators, and inline primitive arrays. On input, GCF achieves 79% token reduction versus JSON at 500 symbols and 34% fewer tokens than TOON on TOON's own benchmark (winning all 6 datasets). On output, LLMs produce valid GCF with 75% fewer tokens than JSON and 52% fewer than TOON. A 13-question comprehension eval at 500 symbols validates 100% accuracy for GCF (13/13), where JSON drops to 76.9% (10/13) and TOON to 92.3% (12/13). Session deduplication (92.7% savings by the 5th call) and delta encoding (81.2% on re-queries) compound savings across multi-turn interactions. A streaming encoding extension enables zero-buffering encode with O(1) memory per row, using a trailer summary for deferred counts. The format is implemented in six languages (Go, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Swift, Kotlin), published to seven package registries, validated by 61 conformance fixtures, and deployed in production MCP servers.

## 1. The Problem: JSON Is the Wrong Format for LLM Interactions

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines how AI agents interact with external tools. Tool responses are overwhelmingly encoded as JSON. This is convenient for developers but expensive for the consumer that matters most: the language model itself.

Consider a typical MCP tool response returning 10 graph nodes and 8 edges (a blast radius query, a dependency subgraph, or a context retrieval result). In JSON, this payload consumes ~965 tokens. The same semantic content in GCF consumes ~233 tokens. The difference, 732 tokens, is pure waste: field name repetition, structural delimiters (`{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `:`, `","`), and full qualified names repeated in every edge reference.

This waste compounds across a task. An agent making 5 tool calls during a code change task consumes ~4,825 tokens on JSON tool responses. In GCF, the same 5 calls consume ~1,165 tokens, and less with session statefulness enabled (previously-transmitted nodes are referenced by local ID without retransmission). The difference, ~3,660 tokens, is context window capacity that could hold source code, documentation, or additional tool results.

### 1.1 Why This Matters Now

Three trends make this problem urgent:

1. **Tool-heavy agent workflows.** Modern AI agents make 10-50 tool calls per task. Each call returns JSON. Token budgets are consumed by tool overhead before the agent finishes its work.

2. **Graph-structured responses are growing.** Code intelligence, dependency analysis, knowledge graphs, and system topology queries all return graph data. Graph payloads are JSON's worst case because they contain repeated node references across edges.

3. **Context window costs are real.** Whether measured in dollars (API billing), latency (time-to-first-token), or capability (what fits in the window), every wasted token reduces the agent's effectiveness.

### 1.2 Why Not Just Use Binary?

Binary formats (Protocol Buffers, MessagePack, FlatBuffers) optimize for byte size and decode speed. But LLMs consume text, not bytes. A protobuf-encoded tool response must be decoded to text before the LLM can process it, and the decoded text is typically JSON, eliminating the savings at the point of consumption.

The optimization target is not bytes on wire. It is tokens in the context window. These are different quantities with different solutions.

---

## 2. Design Principles

GCF's graph profile is designed around three observations about graph data that JSON cannot exploit. Its tabular profile (Section 3.6) generalizes these principles to arbitrary structured data.

### 2.1 Referential Identity

Graph nodes are referenced multiple times: once in their declaration and once per edge they participate in. In JSON, each reference repeats the full qualified name:

```json
{
  "source": "github.com/org/repo/internal/mcp.NewServer",
  "target": "github.com/org/repo/internal/mcp.requireHash",
  "edge_type": "calls"
}
```

In GCF, nodes are declared once with a local ID and referenced by that ID thereafter:

```
@0 fn github.com/org/repo/internal/mcp.requireHash 0.78 lsp_resolved
@4 fn github.com/org/repo/internal/mcp.NewServer 0.54 lsp_resolved
@0<@4 calls
```

The full qualified name appears once per node. Every subsequent reference is 2-3 tokens (`@0`, `@4`) instead of 15-20 tokens.

### 2.2 Topological Encoding

JSON encodes edges as objects with named fields. GCF encodes edges as directed connections:

**JSON (1 edge, ~12 tokens):**
```json
{"source": "...", "target": "...", "edge_type": "calls"}
```

**GCF (1 edge, ~5 tokens):**
```
@0<@4 calls
```

The `<` arrow encodes direction. The source and target are local IDs. The edge type is a bare token. No field names, no delimiters, no quoting.

### 2.3 Hierarchical Grouping

Graph query results often partition nodes by distance from a query center: direct targets (distance 0), related symbols (distance 1), extended context (distance 2+). In JSON, each node carries a `"distance": N` field. In GCF, a section header replaces all per-node distance fields:

```
## targets
@0 fn ... 0.78 lsp_resolved
@1 method ... 0.74 lsp_resolved
## related
@4 fn ... 0.54 lsp_resolved
```

One header replaces N repeated fields.

## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Grammar

```
payload       = header LF { section } [ summary ] ;
section       = group-header LF { line LF } ;
line          = node-line | edge-line | ref-line | tabular-row
              | kv-line | nested-ref | inline-array | comment ;
summary       = "## _summary" SP key-value { SP key-value } LF ;

header        = "GCF" SP key-value { SP key-value } ;
group-header  = "##" SP group-name [ SP "[" count-or-deferred "]" [ field-decl ] ] ;
count-or-deferred = count | "?" ;
field-decl    = "{" field-name { "," field-name } "}" ;
node-line     = "@" id SP kind SP qname SP score SP provenance ;
edge-line     = "@" target "<" "@" source SP edge-type [ SP status ] ;
ref-line      = "@" id SP SP "# previously transmitted" ;
tabular-row   = [ "@" id SP ] value { "|" value } ;
kv-line       = key "=" value ;
inline-array  = key "[" count-or-deferred "]" ":" SP value { "," value } ;
nested-ref    = "." field-name ;
comment       = "#" SP text ;

id            = DIGIT { DIGIT } ;
count         = DIGIT { DIGIT } ;
kind          = "fn" | "type" | "method" | "iface" | "var" | "const"
              | "resource" | "table" | "class" | "selector" | "field"
              | "route" | "ext" | "file" | "pkg" | "svc" ;
status        = "added" | "removed" ;
```

### 3.2 Header

The header line identifies the format and carries payload metadata:

```
GCF tool=context_for_task budget=5000 tokens=1847 symbols=10 edges=8
```

`tool` identifies the MCP tool that produced this response. `budget` and `tokens` enable the consumer to assess utilization. `symbols` and `edges` give counts without scanning.

### 3.3 Node Lines

```
@{id} {kind} {qualified_name} {score} {provenance}
```

Fields are positional. No field names, no delimiters beyond whitespace. Kind abbreviations reduce token count (`fn` vs `"function"`, `iface` vs `"interface"`).

| Abbreviation | Full form |
|-------------|-----------|
| `fn` | function |
| `type` | type |
| `method` | method |
| `iface` | interface |
| `var` | var |
| `const` | const |
| `resource` | resource |
| `table` | table |
| `class` | class |
| `selector` | selector |
| `field` | field |
| `route` | route_handler |
| `ext` | external |
| `file` | file |
| `pkg` | package |
| `svc` | service |

### 3.4 Edge Lines

```
@{target}<@{source} {edge_type} [{status}]
```

The `<` arrow points toward the target. `@0<@4 calls` means "@4 calls @0." Status is optional: `added` or `removed` for diff payloads.

### 3.5 Group Headers

```
## targets
## related
## extended
## edges [N]
```

Group headers partition the payload into semantic sections. The group a node appears in encodes its distance from the query center, eliminating per-node distance fields. The edges section header includes `[N]` (the edge count) to enable direct count verification by the LLM without scanning.

### 3.6 Tabular Profile (Generic Encoding)

The graph profile (Sections 3.1-3.5) encodes typed nodes and edges. The tabular profile encodes arbitrary structured data using the same grammar primitives.

**Tabular arrays:**
```
## {name} [{count}]{{field1},{field2},{field3}}
value1|value2|value3
```

The header declares field names once. Rows are pipe-separated positional values. No field names repeated per record.

```
## employees [3]{id,name,department,salary}
1|Alice Smith|Engineering|95000
2|Bob Jones|Sales|72000
3|Carol Wu|Marketing|85000
```

**Primitive arrays** (all elements are scalars) are inlined on a single line:
```
tags[3]: production,us-east-1,critical
ports[3]: 8080,8443,9090
```

**Key-value pairs** for primitive object fields:
```
config=production
port=5432
active=true
```

**Section headers** for nested objects:
```
## database
  host=db.example.com
  port=5432
```

**Nested fields in tabular rows** use `@{id}` prefixes and `.fieldname`:
```
## orders [2]{id,total,status}
@0 1001|249.99|shipped
  .customer
    name=Alice Smith
    tier=premium
```

**Value encoding rules:**

| Type | Encoding |
|------|----------|
| String | bare text |
| Number | unquoted decimal |
| Boolean | lowercase `true`/`false` |
| Null | `-` |
| Empty string | `""` |
| String containing `|` or `\n` | quoted, with `\"` and `\\` escaping |

**Uniformity detection:** An array is tabular-eligible if the first 5 elements are objects with at least 70% key overlap with the first element, accommodating semi-uniform data.

### 3.7 Session Statefulness

Across multiple tool calls in a session, previously-transmitted nodes can be referenced without retransmission:

```
GCF tool=context_for_files tokens=800 symbols=5 edges=1 session=true
## targets
@0  # previously transmitted
@7 fn github.com/org/repo/internal/mcp.handleBlastRadius 0.62 lsp_resolved
## edges [1]
@0<@7 calls
```

The `session=true` header flag enables ID persistence. A bare `@0` (no kind, name, or score) references a node transmitted in a previous response. Multi-call workflows get progressively cheaper as the session builds a shared vocabulary.

This exploits a property unique to agent tool interactions: the consumer (the LLM) maintains conversational state across calls. A traditional wire format cannot assume its consumer remembers previous messages. GCF can because LLM context windows are, by definition, stateful.

### 3.8 Streaming Encoding Extension

When the encoder does not know payload size upfront (data arriving incrementally from a database cursor, API pagination, or graph traversal), it uses streaming mode:

```
GCF tool=context_for_task budget=5000
## targets
@0 fn pkg.Auth 0.95 lsp_resolved
@1 fn pkg.Handler 0.88 lsp_resolved
## related
@2 type pkg.Config 0.72 ast_inferred
## edges [?]
@0<@1 calls
@2<@0 references
## _summary symbols=3 edges=2 sections=targets:2,related:1,edges:2
```

The `[?]` deferred count marker signals that the count will be provided in the trailer. The `## _summary` line provides all counts after the data is complete. The LLM has both the data and the counts in its context window (recency bias in transformer attention means the trailer is at least as strong a signal as header counts).

Streaming mode enables zero-buffering encode: rows emit the instant they are produced, with O(1) memory per row. This is critical for MCP servers that walk large graphs or paginate results; the LLM starts receiving context immediately instead of waiting for the full traversal.

TOON cannot add streaming without a breaking spec change (their grammar mandates upfront `[N]` with no deferred count or trailer mechanism).

## 4. Implementation Status

GCF is not a speculative format proposal. It is implemented in six languages, published to seven package registries, covered by 61 conformance fixtures, and deployed in production MCP servers handling 94 combined tool endpoints.

The implementation includes:

- **Go library** (`github.com/blackwell-systems/gcf-go`, v0.5.0): Encode, Decode, EncodeGeneric, EncodeWithSession, EncodeDelta, StreamEncoder. Zero dependencies.
- **TypeScript library** (`@blackwell-systems/gcf` on npm, v0.4.0): encode, decode, encodeGeneric, encodeWithSession, encodeDelta, StreamEncoder. Zero dependencies, ESM.
- **Python library** (`gcf-python` on PyPI, v0.4.0): encode, decode, encode_generic, encode_with_session, encode_delta, StreamEncoder. Zero dependencies, Python 3.9+.
- **Rust library** (`gcf` on crates.io, v0.4.0): encode, decode, encode_generic, encode_with_session, encode_delta, StreamEncoder. Minimal dependencies (serde_json).
- **Swift library** (`gcf-swift` via SPM, v0.4.0): encode, decode, encodeGeneric, encodeWithSession, encodeDelta, StreamEncoder. Zero dependencies.
- **Kotlin library** (`gcf-kotlin` via JitPack, v0.4.0): encode, decode, encodeGeneric, encodeWithSession, encodeDelta, StreamEncoder. Zero dependencies.
- **MCP proxy** (`github.com/blackwell-systems/gcf-proxy`): drop-in wrapper for any MCP server, re-encodes JSON responses as GCF with streaming progress notifications. Zero code changes to upstream.
- **Conformance test suite** (61 fixtures across both profiles): language-agnostic JSON fixtures validating encode, decode, session, delta, generic, streaming, and error cases.
- **Specification** (gcformat.com, v1.4): RFC 2119 keywords, conformance checklists, decoder error taxonomy, streaming extension, security considerations.

### Correctness Validation

All six implementations are tested against round-trip invariants and the shared conformance suite. A graph response encoded as GCF and decoded back must preserve node identity, kind, score, provenance, group membership, edge direction, edge type, and optional status metadata. The tabular profile is validated against 18 additional fixtures covering flat arrays, nested objects, value formatting, primitive array inlining, and edge cases.

### Production Deployment

- **knowing** (28 MCP tools): GCF as primary output format for code intelligence, with session deduplication and delta encoding.
- **agent-lsp** (66 MCP tools): GCF tabular output via EncodeGeneric for symbol lists, references, diagnostics, and call hierarchies.

## 5. Where Token Savings Come From

The savings decompose into five sources:

| Source | JSON cost | GCF cost | Savings per occurrence |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| Field names | 9 field names x ~2 tokens each = ~18 tokens/symbol | 0 (positional) | ~18 tokens/symbol |
| Edge references | 2 qualified names x ~15 tokens = ~30 tokens/edge | 2 local IDs x ~1 token = ~2 tokens/edge | ~28 tokens/edge |
| Structural delimiters | `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `:`, `","` = ~6 tokens/symbol | 0 | ~6 tokens/symbol |
| Distance fields | `"distance": N` = ~3 tokens/symbol | 0 (implicit in group) | ~3 tokens/symbol |
| Kind strings | `"function"` = ~2 tokens | `fn` = 1 token | ~1 token/symbol |

For a 10-symbol, 8-edge payload: JSON ~965 tokens, GCF ~233 tokens. The 732-token difference breaks down roughly as: 280 from field name elimination, 224 from edge reference compression, 60 from delimiter removal, 30 from group headers, and the remainder from kind abbreviations and whitespace.

### 5.1 Tabular Profile Savings

The tabular profile achieves savings through a subset of the same mechanisms:

| Source | JSON cost | GCF cost | Savings per occurrence |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| Field names | repeated per record | declared once in header | ~(N-1) x fields per array |
| Structural delimiters | `{`, `}`, `:`, `,`, `"` per record | `|` between values | ~6 tokens/record |
| Array framing | `[`, `]`, commas | `[count]` in header | fixed |
| Primitive arrays | `["a","b","c"]` with brackets and quotes | `name[3]: a,b,c` | ~50% per array |
| Nesting | braces + field names | `.fieldname` + `key=value` | ~50% per nested object |

For 2,000 employee records with 6 fields: JSON ~127,050 tokens, GCF ~49,055 tokens (61% savings). On TOON's benchmark, GCF's tabular profile uses 34% fewer tokens than TOON on mixed-structure data and wins all 6 datasets.

---

## 6. Benchmarks

All benchmarks encode the same semantic content in JSON and GCF. Token counts in Section 6.1 use cl100k_base; the 500-symbol eval (Section 6.1a) and TOON comparison (Section 8.5) use o200k_base (matching TOON's benchmark methodology). Measurements taken on Apple M4 Pro.

### 6.1 Token Comparison

| Payload | Symbols | Edges | JSON tokens | GCF tokens | Savings |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|------------|---------|
| context_for_task | 10 | 8 | 965 | 233 | 75.9% |
| context_for_task (large) | 30 | 24 | 2,968 | 649 | 78.1% |
| context_for_files | 15 | 12 | 1,490 | 334 | 77.6% |
| blast_radius | 8 | 6 | 835 | 208 | 75.1% |
| semantic_diff | 12 | 10 | 1,206 | 295 | 75.5% |
| graph_query | 20 | 16 | 2,078 | 423 | 79.6% |

**Median token savings: 76.7%**

Savings increase with payload size because the ratio of edge references to node declarations grows, and edge references are where compression is strongest.

### 6.1a Comprehension Accuracy at Scale (500 symbols)

A three-way eval at 500 symbols with 200 edges, using 13 structured extraction questions with deterministic ground truth (no LLM judge). Questions span counting (7), extraction (4), and structure (2) categories:

| Format | Accuracy | Tokens | vs JSON |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| **GCF** | **100%** (13/13) | **11,090** | **79% fewer** |
| TOON | 92.3% (12/13) | 16,378 | 69% fewer |
| JSON | 76.9% (10/13) | 53,341 | baseline |

JSON failed on counting tasks: answered 320 instead of 500 for symbol count, answered 240 instead of 166 for target count, failed on function count. At this scale, JSON's field-name repetition (2,500 structurally identical tokens) overwhelms the model's counting circuits.

TOON failed on distance grouping: with no `## targets`/`## related`/`## extended` section headers, the model must scan all 500 rows and filter by a column value, which fails at scale.

GCF is the only format achieving 100% accuracy, and does it in 32% fewer tokens than TOON and 79% fewer than JSON.

### 6.2 Byte Comparison

| Codec | Bytes (10-sym payload) | vs JSON |
|-------|----------------------|---------|
| JSON | 4,153 | baseline |
| GCF | 1,079 | -74% |
| GCB (binary) | 448 | -89% |

### 6.3 Encode Performance

| Codec | p50 latency | p99 latency | Payload size |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| GCF | 38 us | 64 us | 30 symbols |
| GCB | 12 us | 22 us | 30 symbols |
| JSON | 45 us | 78 us | 30 symbols |

GCF encodes faster than JSON (no escaping, no nested object construction). GCB is fastest (direct byte writes, no text formatting). All codecs encode a 30-symbol payload in under 100 microseconds; encoding latency is negligible compared to the graph query that produces the data.

### 6.4 Session Statefulness Savings

| Call | New symbols | Reused symbols | GCF tokens | Cumulative savings vs JSON |
|------|-------------|---------------|------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | 10 | 0 | 233 | 75.9% |
| 2 | 5 | 4 | 128 | 82.3% |
| 3 | 3 | 6 | 87 | 86.1% |
| 4 | 2 | 7 | 62 | 89.4% |
| 5 | 1 | 8 | 41 | 92.7% |

By the fifth tool call in a session, GCF achieves 92.7% token savings versus JSON because 8 of 9 referenced symbols are bare ID references (`@0`, `@3`) consuming 1 token each instead of 15-20 tokens for the full qualified name.

---

## 7. GCB: Companion Binary Format

GCB (Graph Compact Binary) optimizes for machine-to-machine paths where the consumer is not an LLM: daemon IPC, response caching, cross-service transport.

### 7.1 Wire Layout

```
[magic:4 "GCB1"][version:1]
[header]
  tool        : length-prefixed string
  tokens_used : varint
  token_budget: varint
  num_symbols : varint
  num_edges   : varint
[symbols x num_symbols]
  qname       : length-prefixed string
  kind        : uint8 (enum)
  score       : float32 (little-endian)
  provenance  : uint8 (enum)
  distance    : uint8
  signature   : length-prefixed string
  blast_radius: float32
  confidence  : float32
  recency     : float32
  distance_c  : float32
[edges x num_edges]
  source_idx  : varint (index into symbols array)
  target_idx  : varint (index into symbols array)
  edge_type   : uint8 (enum)
  status      : uint8 (enum)
```

### 7.2 When to Use Each Format

| Path | Format | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| MCP tool -> LLM | GCF | Token-optimized, LLM-readable |
| Daemon -> client | GCB | Byte-efficient, fast decode |
| Cache -> disk | GCB | Smallest on-disk footprint |
| Debug/human inspection | JSON | Readable, pipeable to jq |
| Service -> service | GCB | Compact, schema-stable |

## 8. Comparison to Alternatives

### 8.1 Columnar/TSV

Column headers with tab-separated values eliminate field name repetition, achieving ~27% token savings. But TSV treats graph data as flat tables: edge references still require full identifier strings in each row. TSV cannot exploit referential identity (local IDs) or topological encoding (edge arrows). GCF triples the savings.

### 8.2 Binary Formats (Protobuf, MessagePack, FlatBuffers)

These optimize for machine parsing and byte size. An LLM cannot read a protobuf payload; it must be decoded to text first, and the decoded text is typically JSON, eliminating the savings at the point of consumption. Binary formats solve a different problem (machine efficiency) than GCF (LLM token efficiency).

### 8.3 JSON-LD / RDF

Verbose by design: full URIs, type annotations, `@context` declarations. Optimizes for semantic interoperability across systems, not token-constrained consumption. JSON-LD is worse than JSON for LLM tool responses.

### 8.4 Markdown / Freeform Text

Some tools return markdown-formatted text. This is human-optimized, not LLM-optimized. Markdown uses whitespace for structure (indentation, line breaks, headers) which tokenizers handle inconsistently. GCF's positional format produces consistent, predictable token counts regardless of tokenizer implementation.

### 8.5 TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation)

TOON is a tabular encoding format for JSON that declares array fields once and uses comma-separated rows. It achieves 30-60% savings versus JSON on flat tabular data.

**Methodology:** We forked TOON's benchmark repository (`github.com/toon-format/toon`), added GCF as one additional formatter (a single file importing `encodeGeneric` from the published `@blackwell-systems/gcf` npm package), and ran their benchmark harness unchanged. Datasets, tokenizer (gpt-tokenizer, o200k_base), and methodology are entirely upstream. Results:

| Dataset | GCF | TOON | Result |
|---------|-----|------|--------|
| Semi-uniform event logs | 108,158 | 154,032 | **GCF 42% smaller** |
| E-commerce orders | 61,593 | 73,246 | **GCF 19% smaller** |
| Employee records (flat) | 49,055 | 49,966 | **GCF 2% smaller** |
| Analytics time-series | 8,398 | 9,127 | **GCF 8% smaller** |
| GitHub repos | 8,576 | 8,744 | **GCF 2% smaller** |
| Deeply nested config | 616 | 618 | **GCF 0.3% smaller** |

**GCF wins all 6 datasets.** TOON has no token efficiency advantage on any data shape.

TOON has no local-ID system, no edge encoding, no session deduplication, no delta encoding, and no streaming mode. These are structural limitations that cannot be added without a fundamental redesign. TOON edges must repeat the full qualified name of both source and target (~100 tokens per edge vs ~4 for GCF). TOON retransmits every record on every call; GCF tracks what's been sent. TOON's spec mandates upfront `[N]` counts with no deferred mechanism; GCF streams with zero buffering.

On output generation, GCF produces 52% smaller output than TOON at every scale tested (5 to 100 symbols).

Fork with reproducible results: github.com/blackwell-systems/toon (branch: gcf-comparison).

### 8.6 Custom Compressed JSON

JSON with shortened field names (`"qn"` instead of `"qualified_name"`) achieves 15-25% savings. This preserves JSON's structural overhead (delimiters, quoting, nesting) while reducing readability. GCF eliminates the structural overhead entirely rather than shortening the labels on it.

---

## 9. Limitations and Validation

**LLM comprehension.** GCF is a wire format optimized for agentic comprehension, not human scanning. Human readability is a last-mile rendering concern: the agent calls `decode()` when a human needs to see the data. A 13-question comprehension eval at 500 symbols with 200 edges validates this design: GCF achieved **100% accuracy** (13/13 structured extraction tasks) versus JSON at 76.9% (10/13) and TOON at 92.3% (12/13). The concern that LLMs might struggle with GCF's dense positional format was unfounded; the format actually improves comprehension by eliminating structural noise. JSON's field-name repetition (2,500 identical tokens at 500 records) overwhelms the model's counting circuits. GCF's `@N` local IDs, `##` section headers, and `|` pipe separators are more readable to an LLM than JSON's `"qualified_name":` repeated 500 times.

**LLM generation.** A generation eval validated that LLMs can produce valid GCF given a 3-line format primer. At 5 to 100 symbols: 5/5 valid, 75% fewer output tokens than JSON, 52% fewer than TOON. Without a primer, both GCF and TOON achieve 3/5 validity (tied cold-start). GCF is bidirectional: cheaper to read and cheaper to write.

**Two profiles.** The graph profile is optimized for typed nodes and edges. The tabular profile (`encodeGeneric`) handles arbitrary structured data (arrays of objects, nested records, mixed types). On TOON's own benchmark with their datasets and tokenizer, GCF's tabular profile wins all 6 datasets. Primitive array inlining (`name[N]: val1,val2,val3`) eliminated TOON's single remaining advantage on deeply nested config.

**Session statefulness requires coordination.** The session ID system assumes the server tracks which nodes have been transmitted to which client. Stateless deployments cannot use session compression. The non-session mode (full retransmission) remains available.

**Tokenizer dependency.** Token counts depend on the tokenizer. The benchmarks in this paper use o200k_base. Different tokenizers produce different token counts for the same GCF payload, though the relative savings versus JSON are consistent (within 2-3 percentage points).

## 10. Implications for MCP and Agent Tooling

The MCP specification does not define a standard for tool response encoding beyond "the response is a JSON-RPC result." This means every MCP server independently decides how to format its output. The result is that agents receive verbose JSON from every tool, with no mechanism to request compact encoding.

We propose that MCP tool responses should support format negotiation: the client specifies a preferred encoding in the tool call, and the server returns the response in that encoding. GCF (or a format like it) should be available as a standard option alongside JSON.

The token savings are too large to ignore. A 79% reduction in tool response tokens translates directly to: lower API costs, faster time-to-first-token, more room in the context window for source code and reasoning, and fewer multi-turn loops caused by context window exhaustion.

### 10.1 LLM Generation: GCF as a Bidirectional Format

GCF is bidirectional: LLMs can produce it, not just consume it. A generation eval tested whether LLMs produce valid, parseable GCF at scale. Same model (Claude via `claude -p`, zero prior context), same data, validated through the real Go decoder.

**With a 3-line format primer:**

| Symbols | Edges | GCF Valid | GCF Savings vs JSON | TOON Valid | TOON Savings vs JSON | GCF vs TOON |
|---------|-------|-----------|---------------------|------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 5 | 3 | YES | 71% | YES | 31% | **52% smaller** |
| 10 | 6 | YES | 74% | YES | 35% | **53% smaller** |
| 20 | 12 | YES | 75% | YES | 37% | **54% smaller** |
| 50 | 25 | YES | 74% | YES | 40% | **52% smaller** |
| 100 | 50 | YES | 75% | YES | 40% | **52% smaller** |

Both formats achieve 5/5 validity with a primer. GCF output is 52% smaller than TOON output at every scale.

**Without a primer (cold-start):** Both formats achieve 3/5 validity. Neither has a zero-shot generation advantage.

### 10.2 Streaming: Progressive Context Delivery

The streaming encoding extension (Section 3.8) enables a new interaction pattern: **progressive context delivery**. An MCP proxy can emit GCF fragments as MCP progress notifications while the upstream server is still processing. The LLM receives partial context immediately, reducing perceived latency from seconds to milliseconds on large graph traversals.

Combined with MCP's Streamable HTTP transport (Server-Sent Events), this creates a pipeline where graph data flows from the server through the proxy to the LLM token by token, with the trailer summary providing count verification at the end.

### 10.3 Delta Encoding

GCF's token savings compound with delta encoding: when the agent passes a `pack_root` from a prior call and the pack changed, the server sends only added/removed symbols instead of the full payload. Measured: 81.2% additional token savings at 96.6% symbol overlap on re-query scenarios. Combined with GCF's baseline savings and session deduplication, the three-level stack achieves over 97% cumulative token reduction on warm sessions versus stateless JSON.

## 11. Conclusion

JSON is the default encoding for LLM interactions because it is universal, not because it is efficient. For structured data, JSON wastes more than three-quarters of its tokens on structural overhead that carries no semantic content.

GCF eliminates this waste through two encoding profiles. The graph profile uses referential identity (local IDs), topological encoding (edge arrows), and hierarchical grouping (section headers) for code graph data. The tabular profile uses positional rows with pipe separators, section headers, and inline primitive arrays for arbitrary structured data. Both achieve significant savings: 79% versus JSON on graph data at 500 symbols, 34% versus TOON on TOON's own mixed-structure benchmark (winning all 6 datasets).

GCF is bidirectional. A 13-question comprehension eval proves LLMs read it at 100% accuracy where JSON scores 76.9% and TOON scores 92.3%. A generation eval proves LLMs produce it at 75% fewer output tokens than JSON and 52% fewer than TOON. Session deduplication (92.7% by the fifth call), delta encoding (81.2% on re-queries), and streaming encode (zero-buffering with trailer summary) compound savings across multi-turn interactions. No competing format offers these features.

The format is text-based, LLM-optimized, and implementable in any language. Implementations exist in six languages (Go, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Swift, Kotlin) with zero or minimal runtime dependencies. A drop-in MCP proxy enables adoption with zero code changes and adds streaming progress notifications for immediate partial context delivery.

The broader point: GCF is a wire format. Wire formats are not optimized for human readability. HTTP headers are not readable. Protobuf is not readable. Nobody cares; they use a viewer. GCF is the wire format; JSON is the viewer format. The agent reads GCF (cheap, accurate), does its work, then calls `decode()` at the end if a human needs to see the result. Human readability is a last-mile rendering concern, not a wire format property.

The format that looks clean to humans (JSON) is the one that breaks for agents at scale. The format optimized for agentic comprehension (GCF) achieves 100% accuracy at the lowest token cost. This is not a tradeoff. It is a design choice validated by proof.

      "edge_type": "calls"
    }
  ]
}
```

**GCF (233 tokens):**

```
GCF tool=context_for_task budget=5000 tokens=1847 symbols=2 edges=1
## targets
@0 fn github.com/blackwell-systems/knowing/internal/mcp.requireHash 0.78 lsp_resolved
## related
@4 fn github.com/blackwell-systems/knowing/internal/mcp.NewServer 0.54 lsp_resolved
## edges [1]
@0<@4 calls
```

Same semantic content. 75.9% fewer tokens.

## Appendix B: Streaming Example

**Buffered mode** (full payload known upfront):
```
GCF tool=context_for_task budget=5000 symbols=3 edges=2
## targets
@0 fn pkg.Auth 0.95 lsp_resolved
@1 fn pkg.Handler 0.88 lsp_resolved
## related
@2 type pkg.Config 0.72 ast_inferred
## edges [2]
@0<@1 calls
@2<@0 references
```

**Streaming mode** (data arriving incrementally):
```
GCF tool=context_for_task budget=5000
## targets
@0 fn pkg.Auth 0.95 lsp_resolved
@1 fn pkg.Handler 0.88 lsp_resolved
## related
@2 type pkg.Config 0.72 ast_inferred
## edges [?]
@0<@1 calls
@2<@0 references
## _summary symbols=3 edges=2 sections=targets:2,related:1,edges:2
```

Both produce identical `Payload` structures when decoded. The streaming mode enables zero-buffering encode with O(1) memory per row.

## Appendix C: Hash Computation

GCF is format-agnostic with respect to the underlying data model. The examples in this paper use content-addressed graph data (SHA-256 hashed nodes and edges), but GCF encodes the payload structure, not the identity scheme. A GCF encoder receiving nodes identified by database IDs, UUIDs, or string keys would produce identical output; only the `qname` field values would differ.
